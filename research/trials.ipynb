The reason of its popularity lies in\\nits wide range of applications in human society which\\ninclude postal automation [ 3, 4], bank check processing\\n[5, 6], form processing [ 7, 8], etc. Major difﬁculty in rec-\\nognizing the handwritten text is mainly due to the varying\\nwriting styles of individuals. Even the script in which the\\ntext is written can pose additional challenges. For example,\\nsome Indic scripts like Devanagari and Bangla comprise a\\nconsiderably larger character set in comparison with\\nRoman/Latin script. Chinese, Japanese and Korean scripts\\nalso have large character sets but in these scripts characters\\nappear isolated in the text, whereas Indic scripts are very\\noften written in cursive manner. Therefore, development of\\na comprehensive and accurate handwritten text recognition\\nsystem in Indic script is difﬁcult and needs more attention\\nfrom the researchers [ 9].\\nIn the literature, plenty of work can be found for the\\nrecognition of words written in Arabic [ 10–12], Chinese/\\nJapanese [ 13–15] and Roman [ 16–18] scripts. But in\\ncomparison with that very few attempts have been made\\nfor the recognition of words written in Bangla script. With\\nmore than 200 million speakers, Bangla is the seventh most\\nspoken language in the world [ 19]. It is also the second\\nmost popular ofﬁcial language (out of 23 ofﬁcial lan-\\nguages) in India and the national language of Bangladesh.\\nBesides Bangla language, Bangla script is also used to\\nwrite other languages like Assamese and Manipuri.\\nAlthough a signiﬁcant number of work have been reported\\n& Samir Malakar\\nsamirmalakar@ieee.org\\n1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur\\nUniversity, Kolkata, India\\n2 Department of Computer Science, Asutosh College, Kolkata,\\nIndia\\n123\\nNeural Computing and Applications\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-018-3389-1(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789().,-volV)'),\n",

For the evaluation of\\nthis system, a ﬁrst-of-its-kind open-access handwritten\\nBangla word image database, consisting of 18,000 city\\nname images of 120 different classes, is also prepared,\\nwhich is another major contribution of this paper. The\\npaper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the related\\nwork. Section 3 presents the description of the proposed\\nwork including database preparation, preprocessing and\\nfeature extraction. Experimental results are discussed in\\nSect. 4, and ﬁnally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.\\n2 Related work\\nHandwritten text recognition including word recognition is\\ngenerally performed either in online mode [ 23, 24]o ri n\\noff-line mode [ 25, 26]. In online mode, some digital input\\ndevices like tabs or I-pads are used as writing medium\\ninstead of paper, and the recognition is performed simul-\\ntaneously while the writing progresses. But in off-line\\nmode, writing medium is a passive surface such as paper\\nand simultaneous recognition is not possible. In online\\nmode, availability of information like positional informa-\\ntion of strokes, direction of strokes and their order [ 26]\\nmakes the recognition process relatively less complex in\\ncomparison with text written in off-line mode.\\nIn the literature, two different approaches are followed\\nto handle the problem of off-line HWR, namely (1) ana-\\nlytical approach [ 27, 28] and (2) holistic approach [ 29]. In\\nanalytical approach, a word is initially segmented into sub-\\nunits called characters and then each sub-unit is recognized\\nsequentially in order to identify the whole word. Most of\\nthe earlier word recognition solutions have been developed\\nbased on this approach. The major problem with this\\napproach is ﬁnding the proper segmentation points, which\\nbecomes more challenging when the handwriting is cursive\\nin nature. On the other hand, holistic word recognition\\nconsiders a word as a single and indivisible unit and thus\\nextracts information from the whole word to recognize it.\\nIn this way, this approach avoids the segmentation issue.\\nAccording to the authors in [ 29], holistic approach may\\nsucceed even when the writing is too poor for the identi-\\nﬁcation of individual character boundary from the word,\\nbut it preserves the overall shape. It is worth mentioning\\nhere that use of this approach is restricted to the problems\\nwith ﬁxed or limited lexicon. Besides that, this approach\\ncan also be used for the reduction in the lexicon in large\\nvocabulary problems [ 29, 30]. There are many contempo-\\nrary work available in the literature, where holistic\\napproach has been followed to recognize handwritten\\nwords. For example Dasgupta et al. [ 26] have applied\\nArnold transform followed by Hough transform on the\\nword images to get distribution of stroke orientation. Based\\non this information, they have recognized the word images\\nholistically. For evaluation of their work, they have used\\nCENPARMI database of legal amount written in English\\nwith 32 different word classes. Malakar et al. [ 31] have\\nextracted several topological features either from the entire\\nword image or from the hypothetically segmented sub-re-\\ngions of a word image to recognize it holistically. They\\nhave used a database of handwritten Hindi word images\\nhaving 33 different classes to assess the performance of\\ntheir method. Tamen et al. [ 32] have described the word\\nimages at feature space using Chebyshev moments and\\nsome statistical and contour-based features. For classiﬁ-\\ncation, they have used a multi-classiﬁer environment. The\\nmethod is evaluated using a database of handwritten Arabic\\nwords having 21 different word classes, which is basically\\na subset of IFN/ENIT [ 33] database.\\nSimilar to other languages, most of the earlier work on\\nBangla HWR are purely segmentation based [ 3, 4]. As\\nmentioned previously, the major problem with this\\napproach is ﬁnding proper segmentation points. Due to the\\npresence of noise, touching character(s), uneven space\\namong the characters in a word, these techniques may end\\nup with over- or under-segmented characters. To overcome\\nthis problem, character-based Hidden Markov Model\\n(HMM) is used in [ 34, 35]. In these methods, a two-stage\\nrecognition scheme is introduced for words written in\\nBangla. Initially, a given word image is segmented into\\nthree zones, viz., upper, lower and middle. The character\\ncomponents in the segmented zones are recognized sepa-\\nrately, and the zone recognition results are combined to\\ngenerate the ﬁnal word recognition score. The character-\\nbased HMM is used to recognize the middle zone. The\\nproblem of presegmentation of characters from the word\\nimages is solved to some extent by this approach, but it\\nintroduces zone-level segmentation which may also\\nbecome very much error prone for unconstrained hand-\\nwritten words.\\nHowever, in the literature, few attempts can be found\\ntoward the development of a holistic Bangla HWR scheme.\\nSome of those have followed a lexicon-based holistic\\napproach [ 36\\n–38], whereas others have focused on\\nemploying feature descriptor for that purpose. In [ 39],\\nHistogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature descriptor\\nis used for holistic handwritten Bangla word recognition,\\nwhereas in [ 40, 41] Elliptical and convex hull-based fea-\\ntures are used, respectively, for the same. Recently, in\\n[42, 43], gradient-based feature descriptor is used for\\nNeural Computing and Applications\\n123'),\n",

However, most of these\\nmethods are evaluated on a very small dataset, so the\\nrobustness of these methods cannot be assured.\\n3 Proposed work\\nIn the present work, a novel shape-based feature descriptor\\ncalled Tetragonal feature is used along with Vertical pixel\\ndensity histogram-based feature and our previously intro-\\nduced Elliptical feature [40] to capture the shape or geo-\\nmetric nature of a handwritten word image in order to\\nrecognize it in a holistic manner. Recognition process\\nseparately employs two well-known classiﬁers, viz., MLP\\n[44] and SVM [ 45]. Each step of the proposed work is\\nelaborated in the subsequent sections.\\n3.1 Database description\\nOne of the main reasons for the slow progress of research\\non HWR for regional languages is the unavailability of\\nsuitable databases. As holistic HWR systems are generally\\ndeveloped for speciﬁc applications, these mainly deal with\\nlimited lexicons. To carry out training and evaluation of\\nsuch systems, some handwritten word databases like IFN/\\nENIT (in Arabic script) [ 33] and CENPERMI (in Roman\\nscript) [ 46] are made available to the research community\\neither on-demand basis or through subscription charges.\\nHowever, no such standard database comprising Bangla\\nhandwritten words is available in the literature, which can\\nbe used to train and evaluate a holistic HWR system.\\nTo address this need, in the present work, a database of\\n18,000 handwritten Bangla word images, written by around\\n300 different native writers belonging to different age\\ngroups, sex and educational backgrounds, is prepared.\\nWord images in the current database contain the names of\\n120 different cities in West Bengal, a state of India, with\\n150 samples for each city name. The city names listed in\\nTable 1 are chosen based on their population and the lit-\\neracy rate. The present database includes almost all urban\\nregions of West Bengal. Handwritten words in this work\\nwere collected in A4 size datasheets containing a grid of 10\\nrows and 3–5 columns depending upon the word length.\\nThe writers were asked to write each city name inside the\\nrectangular boxes only. Such datasheets are then scanned\\nusing a ﬂat-bed scanner with a resolution of 300 dpi and are\\nstored as 24 bit BMP image ﬁle. From each such image of\\nthe datasheets, handwritten word images are cropped\\nautomatically. More detail description regarding the height,\\nwidth, number of ascendants and descendants of the word\\nimages present in each word class is given in a ﬁle named\\n“ReadMeCMATERdb2.1.2.pdf” along with the database.\\nThis information will help the researchers to get an idea\\nabout how much intra- and/or inter-class shape and size\\nvariation their method may tolerate. More information\\nregarding the samples of the present dataset is given in\\nTables 2 and 3.\\nDatabase nomenclature is an important task for future\\nreference by the research community. The database pre-\\npared in this work is given the name “CMATERdb2.1.2”\\nbased on our predeﬁned naming convention [ 47]. One of\\nthe main contributions of the current work is that the\\ndatabase is made freely available to the entire research\\ncommunity of the said domain. To access the database\\nrefer to the link given in [ 48].\\n3.2 Preprocessing\\nBefore feature extraction, all the word images are\\nsmoothed using disk ﬁlter with radius 4 to remove noise\\nand then binarized using global histogram-based Otsu\\nmethod [ 49]. After that, two morphological operations,\\nviz., erosion and dilation [ 50] are performed on the bina-\\nrized word images using a 3 /C2 3 structuring element to\\nremove the isolated foreground 1 pixels as well as to smooth\\nthe contours of the object regions. These operations also\\nhelp in ﬁlling up the holes, created during binarization,\\nwithin the object regions.\\n3.3 Feature extraction\\nThe proposed feature descriptor is designed with the\\nintension of capturing shape information of a given word\\nimage. In the ﬁeld of object recognition, shape information\\nof an object is heavily relied upon for the discrimination\\npurpose [ 51]. But most of these shape descriptors are\\ncomputationally expensive and require extra memory space\\nfor further processing. Keeping that in mind, in the present\\nwork, shape information of a handwritten word is obtained\\nin terms of local distribution of foreground pixels along\\nwith presence and position of ascendant(s) and descendent\\n(s). For that, from a given word image several Elliptical\\n[40], Tetragonal and Vertical pixel density histogram-\\nbased features are extracted. The proposed descriptor is not\\nonly simple to compute but also effective in recognition of\\nlarge number of handwritten word classes which are truly\\ncomplex in nature.\\n1 By foreground pixels in a word image, we mean object pixels only\\nand the rest of the pixels are considered as representing the\\nbackground. In this paper, we have followed this convention.\\nNeural Computing and Applications\\n123'),\n",

Our endeavor is to use these differences which even-\\ntually help classiﬁer in recognizing the word images.\\nOutermost ellipse After computation of the feature val-\\nues from three hypothetical concentric ellipses, outermost\\nellipse is considered for computation of another ﬁve feature\\nvalues. These are (i) number of foreground pixels on\\nboundary of the ellipse , (ii) number of foreground pixels\\nalong the axis parallel to X -axis, (iii) number of foreground\\npixels along the axis parallel to Y -axis, (iv) ratio of fore-\\nground pixels and background pixels inside the ellipse and\\n(v) ratio of foreground pixels inside and outside of the\\nellipse (not exceeding the minimum bounding box of the\\nword).\\nTo acquire more information about the shape of a word\\nimage, region inside the outermost ellipse is divided into\\nfour sub-regions depending on the center and two foci\\npoints of the ellipse as shown in Fig. 3.

Here the classiﬁcation is carried out sepa-\\nrately using two well-known classiﬁers MLP and SVM. For\\nthat purpose, a machine learning tool called WEKA is used\\n[52]. All the steps of the current experiments along with\\nerror case analysis are described in Sect. 4.1 and ﬁnally in\\nSect. 4.2, comparison of the current work with state-of-the-\\nart feature descriptors as well as methods is presented.\\n4.1 Experimental results and error analysis\\nThe present experiment is carried out by following ﬁvefold\\nand threefold cross-validation schemes using both MLP\\nand SVM classiﬁers. MLP classiﬁer in this experiment has\\n185 neurons in its hidden layer (only one hidden layer is\\nconsidered here) and trained with learning rate ( η) = 0.3\\nand momentum term ( α) = 0.2 for each fold using 1000\\niterations. For SVM classiﬁer, a polynomial kernel is used.\\nAll these parameter values are chosen experimentally. In\\nﬁvefold cross-validation, 14,400 images are used for\\ntraining the model and rest 3600 images are used for\\ntesting, whereas, 12,000 and 6000 word images are used\\nfor training and testing, respectively, for each fold in\\nthreefold cross-validation. Detailed results using MLP and\\nSVM in threefold cross-validation are given in Tables 4\\nand 5, respectively. Outcomes of the ﬁvefold cross-vali-\\ndation scheme using MLP and SVM are given in Tables 6\\nand 7, respectively.\\n4.1.1 System performance with increasing number of word\\nclasses\\nIn the present experiment, performance of the proposed\\nsystem is also observed when number of word classes\\nincreased gradually. For this purpose, entire experiment is\\ncarried out using threefold and ﬁvefold cross-validation\\nTable 4 Threefold cross-validation result using SVM\\nFold\\n#\\nNumber of\\ntraining\\nsamples\\nNumber of\\ntest\\nsamples\\nAccuracy in\\ntraining data\\n(in %)\\nAccuracy in\\ntest data (in\\n%)\\n1 12,000 6000 98.26 76.18\\n2 98.05 80.72\\n3 98.37 73.18\\nBold values indicate the best score\\nTable 6 Fivefold cross-validation result using SVM\\nFold\\n#\\nNumber of\\ntraining\\nsamples\\nNumber of\\ntest\\nsamples\\nAccuracy in\\ntraining data\\n(in %)\\nAccuracy in\\ntest data (in\\n%)\\n1 14,400 3600 97.69 79.44\\n2 97.79 77.33\\n3 97.73 83.64\\n4 98.08 79.3\\n5 97.86 77.19\\nBold values indicate the best score\\nTable 7 Fivefold cross-validation result using MLP\\nFold\\n#\\nNumber of\\ntraining\\nsamples\\nNumber of\\ntest\\nsamples\\nAccuracy in\\ntraining data\\n(in %)\\nAccuracy in\\ntest data (in\\n%)\\n1 14,400 3600 96.23 77.89\\n2 96.60 75.50\\n3 96.32 81.72\\n4 96.65 77.75\\n5 96.58 73.75\\nBold values indicate the best score\\nTable 5 Threefold cross-validation result using MLP\\nFold\\n#\\nNumber of\\ntraining\\nsamples\\nNumber of\\ntest\\nsamples\\nAccuracy in\\ntraining data\\n(in %)\\nAccuracy in\\ntest data (in\\n%)\\n1 12,000 6000 96.92 75.33\\n2 96.39 79.87\\n3 96.92 72.67\\nBold values indicate the best score\\nNeural Computing and Applications\\n123'),\n",

Spelling disparity\\nThe disparity in spellings within the same word class\\ncauses some alarming shape varieties. As the present work\\nestimates some shape-based features, this variation of\\nshapes due to wrong spellings surely misleads the classiﬁer\\nto identify the true class of the word samples. Figure 12\\nillustrates such spelling disparities found in our database.\\n2. Complex shape\\nLarge skew of the word images and complex shape\\nangle can be another two reasons for such misclassiﬁca-\\ntions observed in the current work (see Fig. 13). Since\\nduring the feature extraction, the main focus is given on\\nvarious local regions of any word image, the expected local\\nfeature values of the samples belonging to the same word\\nclass, as shown in Fig. 13, would differ signiﬁcantly due to\\nthe above reasons.\\n3. Similar shaped words from different classes\\nAlong with various geometrical features, some pixel\\ncount features are also estimated from the word images in\\nFig. 9 Performance of the system for different number of word classes using SVM ( a, b) and MLP ( c, d)\\nFig. 10 Number of word classes (in percentage) having recognition\\naccuracy (RA) within a given range\\nNeural Computing and Applications\\n123'),\n",

This comparison is performed in terms of\\nrecognition accuracy, feature dimension and feature com-\\nputation time (see Table 9). Feature descriptors considered\\nfor comparison include, viz., Local Gradient of Histogram\\n(LGH), Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG)\\nand combination of GABOR and PHOG called G_PHOG\\n[53].
